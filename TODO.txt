1) CMD args for procesess
2) better filter (* n other ideas)
3) C and Go (go lib exists - +- maybe)
4) branches - test switch + Sab
5) file access (rethink logic - is that so ness) if ans yes then restr
6) alerts logic refactor
7) SIEM integration? Rethink the method - param is good but .. Meh. Shouda migrate from db mysql to just files
sch now: python daemon + ebpf => DB => user space (acc) + SIEM logs; or else ebpf => log files => alterator and siems by defiolt (a better option for sure)
8) GUI n creating rules => maybe (then second scm file for acc...)
